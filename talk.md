- who here likes pizza?
- why?
- there are facts and opinions
   - facts
     - are either true or false, black or white
     - can be verified
     - machines love them!
   - opinions
     - can be everything, are beyond true and false, are different shades of grey
     - can not be verified
     - impossible to understand for machines
- there is no universal definition for 'like' amongst humans. We understand it, but not exactly.
   - my like is different from yours
   - even in 'my' systerm there are differnt forms of 'like'
     - I like my spouse. I like my dog.
     - Do I like them equally? Is it the same 'liking'?
- why is this a problem? (WIP)
   - humans should be able to add emotions to facts and things
- why do we need a universal definition? (WIP)
   - to connect things and people with emotions and meaning (?)
- why is this important? (WIP)
   - there currently exists a network, a graph of facts
     - machines understand it, it controlls our life
   - how do we integrate the human component into it? how do we add opinions, emotions?
     - how do we take back control? (is this even about control?)
- describe this in pizza terms (WIP)
   - please mail me your opinions about pizza and restaurants in Gent!
