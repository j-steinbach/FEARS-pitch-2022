The world is complex and full of challenges. 
To overcome those challenges progress is needed.

Progress is often facillitated by serendipity -- an unplanned and fortunate discovery. 
Luck, so to speak.

But is it possible to plan serendipity? 
To remove the luck out of the equation? 
To simply find the information we need to overcome a challenge?

The world is full of information. 
And it is becoming ever more. 
So much that it is impossible to look through all of it.

We use machines to help with information discovery. 
They are good at connecting information, comparing facts, and structuring it as Knowledge Graphs.

But machines are also shallow. 
They don't feel and think, don't understand human opinions and emotions. 
They only care about facts and throw away all the human complexities. 
The world is full of information, but machines don't understand half of it. 
They simply are not yet ready to help us.

How do we change that? 
How do we make machines understand? 
How do we enrich the machine-understandable world of facts with human emotions and opinions?

If we manage that, then surely they will help us construct serendipity.
