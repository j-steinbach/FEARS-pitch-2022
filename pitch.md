The world is complex.
Humans are complex.
They live and breathe, feel and think, have opinions and express themselves with emotions.
They contradict each other, misunderstand each other, sometimes even contradict themselves.

Machines in comparison are shallow.
They process facts, don't think, don't feel.
They are incapable of understanding human complexities.

In the context of Knowledge Graphs this is a big problem.
The world runs on a machine-understandable layer of informations; all human-centric knowledge is lost in translation and gets thrown away.
Faceless and inhumane machines are in control, algorithms decide our lives.
They decide and dictate without knowing anything about us.

How do we change that? 
How do we make machines understand? 
How do we enrich the machine-understandable world of facts with human emotions and opinions? 
How do we construct a Knowledge Graph that fully captures human complexities?
