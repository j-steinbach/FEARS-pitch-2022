The world is complex. 
Humans are complex. 
They live and breathe, feel and think, have opinions and express themselves with emotions.

Machines in comparison are stupid. 
They only care about facts. 
They don't think, don't feel. 
They are incapable of understanding humans.

And even amongst humans there are misunderstandings. 
Humans don't understand each other, sometimes even contradict themselves. 
They often don't know what they want, use the same word with different meanings.

In the context of the Semantic Web/Linked Data this is a big problem. 
The world runs on a machine-understandable layer of informations, and all human-centric knowledge is lost in translation and gets thrown away. F
aceless and inhumane machines are in control, algorithms decide our lives. 
They decide and dictate without knowing anything about us.

Why does it have to be that way? 
Why can we not make machines understand? 
Why can we not enrich facts with emotions and opinions? 
Let's understand each other again!
