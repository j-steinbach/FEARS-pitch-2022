The world is complex. 
Humans are complex. 
They live and breathe, feel and think, have opinions and express themselves with emotions.

Machines in comparison are stupid. (RT: You may want to tone this down a bit, maybe just say "Machines in comparison are more efficient in processing facts")
They only care about facts. 
They don't think, don't feel. 
They are incapable of understanding humans. (RT: "understanding humans" -> "understanding human feelings")

And even amongst humans there are misunderstandings. 
Humans don't understand each other, sometimes even contradict themselves. 
They often don't know what they want, use the same word with different meanings.

RT: Everything above is ok, but maybe a bit long. The paragraph below gets into the meat. Could we focus on this a bit more instead, and shorten the above?

In the context of the Semantic Web/Linked Data this is a big problem.  (RT: "Semantic Web/Linked Data" Pick one. Or alternatively: "Knowledge Graphs")
The world runs on a machine-understandable layer of information, and all human-centric knowledge is lost in translation and gets thrown away.
Faceless and inhumane machines are in control, algorithms decide our lives. 
They decide and dictate without knowing anything about us.

Why does it have to be that way? 
Why can we not make machines understand? 
Why can we not enrich facts with emotions and opinions? 
Let's understand each other again!
